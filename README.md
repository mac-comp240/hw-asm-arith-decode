# Decoding Arithmetic Expressions from Assembly Code

## Overview

The goal of this assignment is to practice the mapping between C code and assembly, 
for arithmetic expressions. You can easily convert C code into assembly using the `gcc`. 
Here, you will need to read and understand assembly code that implements functions 
that perform arithmetic calculations, and your goal is to create C code that generates **identical assembly!**

You will create a C code file that contains nothing other than three function 
definitions. **While not required, you _may_** create an additional main program code
file so that you can make sample calls to the three functions to check what they do.


### Rubric

* Overall (1 pt)
    - The `arith.c` file contains three function definitions, no include statements, no main
    function; it does include a descriptive comment at the top with your name in it.

* `arith1` (10 pts)
    - Correct function name and correct number and type of input parameters
    - Correct return value
    - Correct translation of assembly code:
        - Is not a line-by-line translation of the lines of assembly code
        - Performs reasonable condensing of assembly into fewer C lines
        - Uses temporary variables like `t0`, `t1`, to hold intermediate values

* `arith2` (9 pts)
    - Correct function name and correct number and type of input parameters
    - Correct return value
    - Correct translation of assembly code:
        - Is not a line-by-line translation of the lines of assembly code
        - Performs reasonable condensing of assembly into fewer C lines
        - Uses temporary variables like `t0`, `t1`, to hold intermediate values

* `arith3` (8 pts)
    - Correct function name and correct number and type of input parameters
    - Correct return value
    - Correct translation of assembly code:
        - Is not a line-by-line translation of the lines of assembly code
        - Performs reasonable condensing of assembly into fewer C lines
        - Uses temporary variables like `t0`, `t1`, to hold intermediate values

### Starter Files

* `arith_complete.s`
    - This file contains your target assembly code. Reading through it, you will see
    that it contains code for three functions, `arith1`, `arith2`, and `arith3`.
    Your task is to create C code that generates this **exact** assembly code.
* `Makefile`
    - This makefile contains targets for generating assembly code in `arith.s`
    for a C code file `arith.c`, and it also has a special target `compare`, which
    will compare `arith_complete.s` to `arith.s` and report any differences. You
    can use this to check whether your C code is generating the correct assembly.

### Execution

As always, the graders should be able to build, check, and clean your code:

```
make clean
make
make compare
```

The last command should, ideally, print **nothing**!

### Checking your work

The `make compare` command can only be used after you have created `arith.c` and
run `make` to generat `arith.s`. At that point, running `make compare` will
do a character-by-character comparison of `arith.s` and the provided `arith_complete.s`
file.

This runs a unix command called `diff` that can compare 2 files. If your `arith.c`
code is _completely correct_, then when you run `make compare` you will see
the following (nothing printed after `make` prints the command itself):
```
$ make compare
diff -b -B -I '.ident*' -I '.file*' arith.s arith_complete.s
```

When there are differences between `arith.s` and `arith_complete.s`, you may get
something like this:
```
diff -I '.ident*' arith.s arith_complete.s
14c14
<       addl    %rdi, %rdx
---
>       addq    %rdi, %rdx
make: *** [compare] Error 1
```	

Interpreting what is printed above: It is comparing line 14 from both files. The
line with a `<` in front of it comes from your `arith.s` file, and the line with
a `>` in front of it is the corresponding line from `arith_complete.s`. It is
noting the difference between these lines.

The `diff` command can be quite clever, and can often detect extra inserted lines
or missing lines. To learn more about what it does, either type `man diff` in
the terminal, or do a web search for the `diff` Unix command.

When a whole function is still missing as you work, you will see something like
this example:

```
diff -b -B -I '.ident*' -I '.file*' arith.s arith_complete.s
29a30,44
>       .globl  arith3
>       .type   arith3, @function
> arith3:
> .LFB2:
>       .cfi_startproc
>       movzbl  %dil, %edi
>       movzbl  %sil, %eax
>       addl    %edi, %eax
>       movl    %eax, %edi
>       sall    $7, %edi
>       addl    %edi, %eax
>       ret
>       .cfi_endproc
> .LFE2:
>       .size   arith3, .-arith3
make: *** [compare] Error 1
```

This is showing that there are a set of lines in `arith_complete.s` that have
no corresponding lines in your file.


## Tasks to Complete

### Task 1: Understand the assembly code in `arith_complete.s`

- Make a copy of the `arith_complete.s` file under a different name. This is so
that you can add notes and comments to the copy, without changing the original 
`arith_complete.s` file.

- Work in stages on one function at a time:
    - Determine the number and type of input parameters to each function, and the type
of the return value. For input parameters: look for registers that are **used** without
first being given a value.
    - For each line, determine the effect of the line, tracking data moving around, and write the result in normal arithmetic

**Hints:**
- The C code will never, itself, perform a **left shift** operation: if left shifts
occur in the assembly they are being used as part of an arithmetic expression (multiplying
by powers of 2).
- The `mov` command is sometimes used to keep a copy of a variable for use later.
- Registers may be reused over the course of a function to hold different values. This
is even true of those used initially to hold input parameter values. And sometimes
a register that **could** be used for an input is instead just being used to hold
intermediate values. Read carefully!

### Task 2: Write the C functions

- Work in stages, one function at a time, not all at once! If you get stuck on one,
go on to the others and then come back.
- Create each C function, making sure to use the correct type and number of input
parameters and the correct return type
- Look at the steps in the assembly language, and determine a condensed number of steps
for your C code
    - Sometimes the assembly code may cast between types (seen as a combination of different
    register sizes in a single instruction). Use **explicit casting** in your C code
    when this happens.
    - Reducing the C code to a single line can cause problems: use intermediate variables
    where they are sensible
    - In the solution, the assignment statements contain expressions on the right-hand side that have 1 or two variables, which are either input parameters to the function or the temporary intermediate variables. Avoid combining expressions in the assignments or the return statement. However, do be sure to combine variables in the expression: each variable should occur once per expression on the right-hand side of an assignment.
    - Be prepared to try different ways to condense the code if needed
    - Use reasonable variable names and good coding style throughout!
 
## Submission

When you have completed the **code** for this assignment, make sure to complete the **report** 
before final submission. Submit your report in a new file called `TURNIN.md`. Your report should include:

* A list of known bugs or issues in the code.
    * Give as much detail as necessary for a grader to understand the issue! Do not write only that something does not work.
* What challenges you faced while completing the assignment.
    * Reflect on the experience of doing this work. What were some of the sticking points? Did you get help? How did you solve them?
* What you learned through completing this assignment.
    * Reflect on your learning. Did the assignment illustrate any course concepts or build on what you practiced in the activities? Is there anything that you understand better because of this homework?
